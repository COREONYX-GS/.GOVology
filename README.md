Studying Data from the US Government's .gov Domain Registry

Utilizing [the data available](https://get.gov/about/data/) for the .GOV registry as well as [TTS' Site Scanning Program](https://digital.gov/guides/site-scanning/) I've started taking a look at some of the forms and functions that seem to be represented in the data.

Note, this is not my operational repository which has some other ad-hoc analysis that is waiting to be finalized before publishing but I wanted to share the baseline automation for others who might find it interesting.
